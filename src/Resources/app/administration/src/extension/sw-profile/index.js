/**
 * Adds a "Passkeys" tab to the admin's own profile page ("Mein Profil") for
 * self-service register/delete of that admin's own credentials - mirrors the
 * Magento reference module's own-account passkey management, and is kept
 * entirely separate from the Settings > Passkey-Einstellungen grid (that one
 * is the cross-admin lockout-recovery tool; this is "manage my own").
 *
 * sw-profile-index's tab bar is plain, hardcoded <sw-tabs-item> markup in
 * the exact v6.7.14.0 source this plugin targets (not the data-driven
 * mt-tabs used from 6.8 onward behind a feature flag) - appending a sibling
 * item right after the existing "General" tab's own named block is the
 * reliable way to inject into the middle of that markup via twig block
 * overriding, since block substitution happens on the raw template string
 * before Vue ever compiles it into a render tree.

 * (children already flattened to arrays, names/paths already absolute) are
 * passed through every registered routeMiddleware exactly once, so pushing
 * onto currentRoute.children here is enough; no routes manifest is needed
 * for this module at all.
